The ID_extraction is the main file that needs to be executed
The kegg_compound_list.mat file is the database of different compounds available in KEGG database and their respective identifiers .
On executing file "ID_extraction.m", an input dialog box pops up as asking for different file names needed to execute ASAPP.
The folder "Sample" has got a few sample files which contains random combination of compounds. One can test the program with those samples. One can also create a text file consisting of a list of compound names of their choice and accordingly assign the path of the file to the variable compoundfile
